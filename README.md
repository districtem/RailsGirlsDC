Meetup_Group
============


This repository holds a collection of meeting notes, homework and (in the future) code from our Rails Girls DC open-source projects.

Our next three meetings are scheduled for February 12th, February 28th, and March 12that <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=1203+19th+street+nw,+washington,+dc+20036&sugexp=chrome,mod%3D5&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&sa=N&tab=wl">BrowserMedia/nclud space</a> in Washington, DC from 5pm-9pm.

You can RSVP for the Meetups <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls/Washington-DC/">Here</a>

The aim of the group is to lay down some code and connect with fellow developers.  After the first three events we will set regular meeting dates and decide on an open-source project.

We communicate via our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/railsgirlsdc">mailing list</a>.  You can also catch us on Twitter<a href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsDC">@RailsGirlsDC</a>

We look forward to seeing you at the Rails Girls DC Meetups!
