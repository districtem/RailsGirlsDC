Meetup_Group
============


This repository holds a collection of meeting notes, homework and (in the future) code from our Rails Girls DC open-source projects.

Our first three meetings will be held December 19th, January 7th, and January 24th at <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=1203+19th+street+nw,+washington,+dc+20036&sugexp=chrome,mod%3D5&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&sa=N&tab=wl">BrowserMedia/nclud space</a> in Washingt, DC from 5pm-9pm.

The aim of the group is to lay down some code and connect with fellow developers.  After the first three events we will set regular meeting dates and decide on an open-source project.

We communicate via our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/railsgirlsdc">mailing list</a> 

We look forward to seeing you at the Rails Girls DC Meetups!
