Meet-Up Goals Dec 19th 
======================

> At the first few Meet-Ups we will establish regular meeting days each  month for future events, establish what attendees want to learn, and tailor future events accordingly. 

Projects for this Meet-Up
------------------------- 
- Work on [Tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0) again.  Did you learn anything new? 

- Join the Rails Girls DC group on [Codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/00) and work through some tutorials.  Try running some of your own code in your <code>irb.</code> 

- Continue where you left off at the Rails Girls DC Workshops and work through some more [Rails Girls guides](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/)

- Find others at the Meet-Up who are working through the same problems.  Start a conversation about what you're learning and working on.
