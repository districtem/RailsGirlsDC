Projects for this Meet-Up
------------------------- 
1.  The ultimate goal of this group is to build an open-source project.  Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one and clone or fork this repository onto your machine.
    - What is the difference in cloning and forking?
    - What is the purpose of using GitHub for our project?
    - Here's a link to help you out <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/"></a>

2.  Once you have a GitHub account familiarize yourself with Git.
    - What is Git? Is Git different from GitHuB?

3.  Commit and push the repository back from your local machine to GitHub.

4.   If you're a GitHub pro or want to focus on Ruby, visit one of these sites.  Spend an hour working on the sites and write down all your questions.  Find someone close to you to discuss your questions.  Don't worry!  We don't bite!
